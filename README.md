# AzureAndO365Scripts
Various scripts that I have worked on throughout the years


<H1> Rules for Script Creation </H1>
1. Create a header for each script with the following info <br>
   - Created By <br>
   - Date Last Modified <br>
   - Overview of usage <br>
   - Permissions <br>
   - Additional Notes <br><br>
2.  If it can be a function, make it a function <br><br>
3.  Add additional notes in each function for specific information important to that function <br>
    - This 100% includes documentation (i.e. msft kb docs) on what the commands do and their purpose <br><br>
4.  Comment above any lines that need to be changed <br><br>
